Here's how you push to github:
```
git push
```
Reminders for tomorrow:
* Know the order for git.
* Review the commands for creating files, reading files, and adding content into files.

## Header
This uses a large header

### Bullet
This is a smaller header
* Use the asterick sign to make a bullet.

### List
1. Use numbers to make a numbered list.

This is how you _insert_ HTML:
```html
<p> I drank that?</p>
```
You use the ``` sign. Top left corner of keyboard.

Put underscores around words to make them _italics_.

Put astericks around word to make them **bold**.
